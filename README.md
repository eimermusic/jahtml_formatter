# JahtmlFormatter

JahtmlFormatter tweakes the CSS of the Rspec HtmlFormatter to make it better for **me** to print to pdf and include in V&V Reports. Fun stuff. It it probably not very useful or interesting to anyone else.


## Installation

$ bundle exec rspec --format JahtmlFormatter -o spec_output.html

To use JahtmlFormatter by default, put the options in a .rspec file:

--format JahtmlFormatter
-o spec_output.html


## Contributing

This is likely not very interesting to contribute to either. :)
